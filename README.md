# CodeAlpha_Sentiment-Analysis
For this stage, I applied sentiment analysis to the cleaned dataset to understand how patients perceive different drugs and conditions.

## 🔑 Key Insights

###  Overall Sentiment Split:
- Positive → 48.4%
- Negative → 46.8%
- Neutral → 4.8%
 
**Patient** experiences are highly polarized, with nearly equal numbers of satisfied and dissatisfied users.
  
### Condition-Level Findings:

- Birth Control → highest review volume, but highly mixed (praise + side effect complaints).
 
- Depression, Pain, Anxiety → skewed more negative (effectiveness + tolerability issues).

- Acne, Insomnia, Obesity, ADHD → more balanced sentiment compared to the above.
  
### Themes in Feedback:

- Negative: pain, side effects, taking, mg, started → concerns about side effects, dosing, early treatment experiences.

- Positive: day, like, effects, first, get, years → improvements in daily life, long-term use, and quick relief.

### Trends Over Time (2008–2017):

- Sentiment activity spiked after 2014, peaking in 2015–2016.
- Negative reviews often outpaced positives during spikes → growing patient concerns around certain treatments.
  
### 📊 Visualizations

###  💊 Implications

- Healthcare Providers → Monitor patient-reported side effects; manage expectations in mental health and reproductive health.
  
- Pharmaceutical Companies → Negative feedback about “side effects” highlights need for safer formulations, patient education, and follow-up.
  
- Business Intelligence Teams → Sentiment insights help identify unmet patient needs, guide quality improvements, and shape engagement strategies.

📌 In Summary : Patient experiences are highly polarized — nearly half positive, nearly half negative. This emphasizes the importance of side-effect management, drug improvement, and patient communication in healthcare and pharma strategy.
